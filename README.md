# Tennis League Manager WebApp

User-friendly web application designed to streamline the creation, organization, and management of the club tennis leagues. This tool simplifies the entire process, from setting up a league to adding players and effortlessly updating scores.

The project originated from the need of the Highbury and Islington Tennis Club to simplify their current process, which involved maintaining the league data manually on an Excel spreadsheet. With every score report, there would be a manual update followed by a screenshot upload to the existing website to display the updated scores.
