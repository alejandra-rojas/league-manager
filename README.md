# league-manager

This project is built as part of the last course in the Frontend Developer course at Hyper Island (Stockholm). 

The objective of the projects is to practive the skills and knowledge acquired through the education, while combining it with something we are passionate about. 

I decided to build a webapp for tennis leagues. The application will allow admins to easily create tennis leagues and intuitively manage all its details from creation of the leagues, to adding players and updating scores. 
The webapp will also provide the relevant statistics for the players, so they can know the details of the league and its current standings. 

The idea for this project comes from a real neccesity of the Highbury and Islington Tennis Club to manage their league easily. At the moment, their leagues data is kept on excel and it is manually updated everytime a score is reported. Then, a screenshot is taken and uploaded to their current website: https://www.highburytennisclub.com/doubles-league.html

Once completed, I would also like to start a tennis league in Stockholm. 

The project tech stack: React, Tailwind, Express and Postgres.
