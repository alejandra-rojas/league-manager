# league-manager

This project is built as part of the last course in the Frontend Developer course at HyperIsland.

The objective of the projects is to practice the skills and knowledge acquired through the program, while combining it with something we are passionate about.

I decided to build a webapp for tennis leagues. The application will allow admins to easily create tennis leagues and intuitively manage all its details; from league creation, to adding players and updating scores among others. The webapp will also provide the relevant details and league standings to the public.

The idea for this project comes from a real necessity of the Highbury and Islington Tennis Club to manage their league easily. At the moment, their leagues data is kept on excel and it is manually updated every time a score is reported. Then, a screenshot is taken and uploaded to their current website.

Once I complete this project, I would like to use this to start a tennis league in Stockholm.

The project tech stack: React, SCSS, Express and Postgres.
